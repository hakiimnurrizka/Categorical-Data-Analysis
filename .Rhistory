#Next we can do whats known as chi-square test of independence.
#This is a hypothesis test to inspect whether job class is independent with the wage category or not
chisq.test(con1)
#From the chi square test above, it can be concluded that job class is not independent to the wage category.
#This is a strong indication of the relationship between the two categories.
#There is also an alternative the chi square test called the fisher exact test, this test is used instead of the
#chi square test when the number of observation is relatively low.

#fit seems to be poor. But at the same time, by using rule of thumb on the residual deviance against the degree
